        <p>Gel nail polish brands typically wear longer than regular nail polish brands — about two to three weeks on average. This type of nail polish offers a professional salon-like shine and isn’t as prone to chipping or wearing away during traditional everyday activities. It comes in various stylish colors, from classic opaque to vivid shimmer. It’s worth noting that gel nail polish can take some time to apply due to the curing process, and it can be time-consuming and difficult to take off, because you can’t wipe the polish off with traditional nail polish remover. You need more tools with gel polish than with traditional polishes, and it can easily damage your nails, especially if they’re already thin and brittle.</p>
        <p>Nail polish is a lacquer that can be applied to the human fingernail or toenails to decorate and protect the nail plates. The formula has been revised repeatedly to enhance its decorative effects and to suppress cracking or peeling. Nail polish consists of a mix of an organic polymer and several other components that give it colors and textures. Nail polishes come in all shades of color and play a significant part in manicures and pedicures.</p></div>
